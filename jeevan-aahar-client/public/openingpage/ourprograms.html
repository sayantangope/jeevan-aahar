                        <h3>Feeding Through Technology</h3>
                        <p>We leverage technology to solve hunger challenges. Our mobile application enables fast food listings, QR-based pickups, and live tracking to ensure surplus food never goes to waste. The platform connects food donors with distribution volunteers in real-time, significantly reducing the time between food availability and delivery to those who need it.</p>

                        <h3>Food Rescue</h3>
                        <p>Our dedicated food rescue program collects surplus food from restaurants, events, and corporate cafeterias, reducing food waste while feeding those in need. Our trained volunteers ensure that all food collected meets safety standards and is quickly delivered to distribution centers, shelters, and community kitchens across the country.</p>

                        <h3>Community Kitchens</h3>
                        <p>We collaborate with local partners to set up community kitchens in underserved areas. These kitchens provide nutritious, freshly-cooked meals daily to those who can't afford them. Our community kitchens also serve as training centers where we teach cooking skills, nutrition education, and food safety practices to local residents.</p>

                        <h3>Food Education & Awareness</h3>
                        <p>We run awareness drives and workshops in schools, colleges, and communities to educate people about food sustainability, nutritional value, and the impact of food waste. Our educational programs empower communities with knowledge about balanced diets, sustainable food practices, and how small changes can make significant impacts on both health and environment.</p>
